discussion sessions, interact with each other and sponsors, and manage
registration.

non-students and give full access to the virtual conference platform,
including the workshop and main conference events.

More detailed information on registration and access to the virtual
conference platform will be announced on [roboticsconference.org](https://roboticsconference.org) by end
