Our mission is to support members of the RSS community with children in their lives and enable their increased participation in RSS. RSS is committed to facilitating the participation in the conference by parents and families. We recognize that it can be tough to balance professional travel with kids, and we want to offer families options to make things work.

#### Caregivers and Children

For families who bring their children along with their own caregiver, Boston is
a wonderful destination for families and kids. Below is a list of suggested
activities that are easily accessible from Kendall Square, the T stop closest to
the conference venue. We are creating a signup for for caregivers who wish to be
connected with each other to organize group activities. Caregivers and kids are
welcome at all RSS events and are welcome to partake in all the food. We will
provide a "kids table" at the poster sessions that will have kid-friendly
activities such as coloring books, robot-centered activities and toys.

We will also have a lab tour of MIT focused on kids, that will include "hands
on" demos of Baxter and the Aibo robot puppy, that you can sign up for at the
registration desk.

#### Parent Networking

We will have a lunch networking event for parents at RSS, whether or not you are
bringing your kids. Anyone who has an interest in kids and robotics is welcome
to attend.

#### Lactation Rooms and Changing Tables

MIT has [several lactation rooms][lactation rooms] available on campus. We are
also providing lactation rooms at Kresge (the conference venue) and the Stata
Center (the workshop venue). Please contact the conference organizers if you
have questions or need additional resources.
