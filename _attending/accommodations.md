We are working towards procuring discounted rates for 
both student housing and hotels near the conference venue.
Stay tuned for updates!
</p>

There are a number of hotels available in the area. Two major hotels are offering rooms to RSS attendees at discounted rates. Please book online with these hotels:

**Boston Marriott Cambridge**
50 Broadway Cambridge, MA 02142

**Hyatt Regency Cambridge**
575 Memorial Dr., Cambridge, MA 02139

Both hotels are roughly the same distance to the main conference venue. The Marriott is closer to the other buildings on campus.
