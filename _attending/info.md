<center><i>Thank you for joining the first virtual RSS!</i></center>

<br/>

* The virtual conference will be held on
[**https://pheedloop.com/rss2020/virtual/**](https://pheedloop.com/rss2020/virtual/).
* When attending the conference, please respect the
[**RSS 2020 Code of Conduct**](../codeOfConduct/).
* Help & Technical support is provided at the **Help Desk Meetup** on the virtual platform.
* **Best experience with zoom sessions**: Try to log into *some* zoom account in a separate brower tab. This will generate some cookies that might avoid you having to enter credentials and CAPTCHAs every time you switch between sessions.



## The Paper Discussion Sessions

The dissemination and discussion of the newest state-of-the-art
research in robotics is the most important role of RSS. We therefore
let live discussion sessions of all accepted papers take the central
part of the RSS virtual program.

The goal of these discussion sessions is to enable a free and open
discussion round and exchange - in analogy to **poster sessions** at
previous RSS conferences. Rather than only passively consuming videos/talks,
you should actively engange and ask questions.

During the 2 hour sessions you might want to alternate between
* Browsing the accepted papers, watching their pre-recorded presentations
* Joining the live discussion sessions and directly ask the authors questions.


## Technical Help

### Prefer a Chrome/Chromuim browser

The embedded zoom windows can properly be made full screen and all
functionalities be used with Chrome. Other browsers raised problems.

The social meetups at
[spatial chat](https://spatial.chat/s/RSS2020Hallway) will only work
with Chrome.

### Avoiding CAPTCHAs

Whenever you switch sessions, the embedded zoom windows might let you
enter CHATCHAs.

In our experience this can be avoided by signing into ANY zoom account
with the same browser (in another tab). Perhaps the reason is that
this generates a cookie which makes zoom generally believe that you're
not a bot.

Further note that some privacy/anti-tracking browser extensions might
make it impossible to avoid the CAPTCHAs, possibly as they block
cross-site cookies.

We generally realized that cookies cause quite a diverse behavior for
different users -- so if in doubt, try to clear all cookies, log into
some zoom account, then log into our virtual conference site.

### Don't open Q&A/chat in tiny zoom windows

A curiosity: When you open Q&A or chats in a very small screen zoom
window, it takes so much space that you cannot see anything anymore
and cannot close it anymore - you're stuck. (You can re-click the
session, of course.)
