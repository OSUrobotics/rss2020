As technology in autonomous robotics continues to evolve, so does the
complexity of the decision problems that we expect our systems to solve. Such
action policies range from low-level control of forces to high-level selection
of complex strategies. These decision problems are often straightforward for
humans while they remain difficult for standard robotics approaches. In this
context, Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) can reduce the difficulty of
defining action policies by providing expert knowledge in the form of examples
of near-optimal behaviors. Understanding and formalizing LfD has been the topic
of many fields of science including robotics, neuroscience, cognitive science,
psychology and anthropology. However, many LfD problems are still intractable
due to the embedding of exceedingly high-dimensional representations that stem
from their coupling to high-dimensional observation spaces (e.g., visual,
haptic or auditory). In this workshop, we will present and initiate a
discussion on the techniques that could allow to handle this
high-dimensionality. We are inviting experts in machine learning, cognitive
science and robotics with the aim to foster collaboration and share new ideas
across this multidisciplinary field. A special emphasis will be put on inverse
optimal control and inverse reinforcement learning, which allow for the
construction of reward signals from high-dimensional feature spaces, as well as
LfD techniques based on Deep Neural-Networks.
