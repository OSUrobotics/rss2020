Robots are leaving the cages of the industrial manufacturing production lines
and the safety of research labs, and moving into the unstructured environments
of everyday life. From human-in-the-way to human-in-the-loop, modern robotics
problems typically involve robot interactions with and around humans. Solving
such problems requires research in complementary areas: <i>algorithmic
robotics</i>, such as motion planning and machine learning, and
<i>human-robot interaction</i> (HRI), such as cognitive modeling, intention
recognition, and activity prediction. Both areas have much to contribute to
each other in terms of methods, approaches, and insights, and yet the
algorithmic robotics and human-robot interaction communities remain largely
disjoint groups. There are four goals for this workshop: to (1) <i>expose
approaches</i> from HRI that inform algorithmic models of humans, (2)
<i>identify</i> mathematical and algorithmic tools to address HRI problems, (3)
<i>encourage conversation</i> between researchers in the areas of HRI and
fundamental algorithms for robotics, and (4) <i>raise a series of open
questions</i> that fall in the intersection of algorithmic robotics and HRI.
