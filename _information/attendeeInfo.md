### Prefer a Chrome/Chromuim browser

The embedded zoom windows can properly be made full screen and all
functionalities be used with Chrome. Other browsers raised problems.

The social meetups at
[spatial chat](https://spatial.chat/s/RSS2020Hallway) will only work
with Chrome.

### Avoiding CAPTCHAs

Whenever you switch sessions, the embedded zoom windows might let you
enter CHATCHAs.

In our experience this can be avoided by signing into ANY zoom account
with the same browser (in another tab). Perhaps the reason is that
this generates a cookie which makes zoom generally believe that you're
not a bot.

Further note that some privacy/anti-tracking browser extensions might
make it impossible to avoid the CAPTCHAs, possibly as they block
cross-site cookies.

We generally realized that cookies cause quite a diverse behavior for
different users -- so if in doubt, try to clear all cookies, log into
some zoom account, then log into our virtual conference site.

### Don't open Q&A/chat in tiny zoom windows

A curiosity: When you open Q&A or chats in a very small screen zoom
window, it takes so much space that you cannot see anything anymore
and cannot close it anymore - you're stuck. (You can re-click the
session, of course.)
