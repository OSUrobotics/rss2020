The 2017 Robotics: Science and Systems Conference will bring together researchers working on algorithmic and mathematical foundations of robotics, robotics applications, and analysis of robotic systems. We seek your best work in all areas of robotics and solicit papers that cover both the “Science” and the “Systems” of robotics.

The conference will be single-track, and the final program will be the result of a thorough review process to give attendees an opportunity to see the best research in all areas of robotics. Submissions will be evaluated in terms of their technical quality, novelty, significance, potential impact, and clarity.

The program will include invited talks as well as oral and poster presentations of refereed papers. The three-day main session will be followed by two days of workshops and tutorials. Workshop-only registration will also be available. Every effort is being made to keep conference expenses affordable, particularly for student attendees.

This year, we are especially excited to showcase the following two themes via special sessions at the conference:

*  **Kinematics, Dynamics, and Control:** Dexterous Manipulation, Locomotion, Nonlinear Control, Visual Servoing
*  **Mechanisms:** Design, Humanoids, Hands, Legged Robots, Flying Robots, Underwater Robots, Novel Actuators, Reconfigurable Robots, MEMS/NEMS, Micro/Nanobots

## Important Dates

* Full Paper Submission: Monday January 30, 2017, Anywhere on Earth
* Paper Notification: April 30, 2017
* Conference Dates: July 12-16, 2017 (Main Conference: July 12-14, Workshops: July 15-16)
* Submissions will either be accepted or rejected. This year, RSS will not have a rebuttal phase, nor conditional acceptances.


## Themes

RSS is actively seeking papers in areas that have not been traditionally represented at the conference and will stay true to its name covering both the “Science” and the “Systems” of robotics. Papers containing original and unpublished work are solicited in all areas of robotics, including (but not limited to) the following themes:

* **Kinematics, Dynamics, and Control:** Dexterous Manipulation, Locomotion, Nonlinear Control, Visual Servoing
* **Mechanisms:** Design, Humanoids, Hands, Legged Systems, Snakes, Novel Actuators, Reconfigurable Robots, MEMS/NEMS, Micro/Nanobots
* **Planning and Algorithms:** Motion Planning, Task Planning, Coordination, Complexity and Completeness, Computational Geometry, Simulation,
* **Manipulation:** Contact Modeling, Grasp Synthesis, Assembly, Force Control, Manipulation Planning
* **Human-Robot Interaction and Human Centered Systems:** Brain-Machine Interfaces, Haptics, Tactile Interfaces, Telerobotics, Human Augmentation, Assistive Robots, Social Robots, Safe Interaction, Robots and Art
* **Field Robotics:** Underwater Robotics, Aerial/Space Robotics, Agricultural and Mining Robotics
* **Formal methods:** Safety, Verification, Validation, Correct-by-construction Systems, Controller Synthesis, Certification
* **Distributed Systems:** Multi-Robot Systems, Networked Robots, Robot Soccer
* **Medical Robotics:** Robot-Assisted Procedures, Smart Surgical Tools, Rehabilitation Robotics, Interventional Therapy, Image-Guided Procedures, Surgical Simulation, Soft-Tissue Modeling, Telesurgery
* **Biological Robotics:** Biomimetic Robotics, Robotic Investigation of Biological Science and Systems, Neurobotics, Prosthetics, Robotics and Molecular Biology
* **Robot Perception:** Vision, Tactile and Force Perception, Range Sensing, Inertial and propreoceptive sensing, Sensor Fusion

## Author Information

Please visit the [author information]({{site.baseurl}}/information/authorinfo) page for extensive instructions.

## Special Journal Issues

About _half_ of the selected papers will be invited for submission to a special issue of International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR) and a special issue of Autonomous Robots (AuRo). For example, out of the 57 accepted papers in RSS 2014, 15 appeared in the [IJRR Special Issue](http://ijr.sagepub.com/content/35/1-3.toc), and 13 in the [AuRo Special Issue](http://link.springer.com/journal/10514/39/3/page/1).
