The 2020 {{site.title}} Conference will bring together researchers working on
all aspects of robotics including scientific foundations of robotics, robotics
applications, and analysis of robotic systems. We seek your best work in all
areas of robotics and solicit papers that cover both the “Science” and the
“Systems” of robotics.

The conference will be single-track, and the final program will be the result of
a thorough review process to give attendees an opportunity to see the most
exciting research in all areas of robotics. Submissions will be evaluated in
terms of their novelty, technical quality, significance, potential impact, and
clarity.

The program will include invited talks as well as oral and poster presentations
of refereed papers. The three-day main session will be preceded by two days of
workshops and tutorials. Workshop-only registration will also be
available. Every effort is being made to keep conference expenses affordable,
particularly for student attendees.

## Important Dates

* Full Paper Submission: January 30, 2020
* Paper Notification: April 16, 2020
* Conference Dates: July 12 - 16, 2020
* Submissions will either be accepted or rejected. This year, RSS will not have a rebuttal phase, nor conditional acceptances.


## Author Information

Submissions may be up to 8 pages in length, excluding references. Reviewing for
RSS 2020 is double-blind, so authors should not be listed on the title page, and
reasonable anonymity should be maintained in the paper. Submissions that are
identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously
published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel
to other conferences are not appropriate for RSS and violate our dual submission
policy; exceptions to this rule are detailed on the author information page on
the RSS 2020 website.

Submissions will be evaluated in terms of their technical quality, novelty,
significance, potential impact, and clarity. All papers accepted for
presentation at the main conference will be published in the online
proceedings. Selected papers will be invited for submission to a special issue
of the International Journal of Robotics Research and a special issue of
Autonomous Robots.

## Special Journal Issues

About _half_ of the selected papers will be invited for submission to a special issue of International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR) and a special issue of Autonomous Robots (AuRo). For example, out of the 57 accepted papers in RSS 2014, 15 appeared in the [IJRR Special Issue](http://ijr.sagepub.com/content/35/1-3.toc), and 13 in the [AuRo Special Issue](http://link.springer.com/journal/10514/39/3/page/1).
