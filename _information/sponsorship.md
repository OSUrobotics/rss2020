We offer several opportunities for sponsors at RSS 2020:

1. Logos on the pre-recorded video presentations for the accepted papers, which will be uploaded on youtube.
2. An exhibit (~virtual booth) on the central conference platform with integrated chat and video conferencing tool to interact with RSS attendees, and therefore the opportunity to interact with interested attendees directly.
3. Logos directly on the conference platform and acknowledgements on
roboticsconference.org

Please contact Bill Smart <Bill.Smart@oregonstate.edu> and Hadas Kress-Gazit <hadaskg@cornell.edu> if you are interested in supporting RSS 2020.
