We are currently planning the events and budget for RSS 2017. Sponsorship of
our conference provides an opportunity to support one of the premiere
international robotics conferences showcasing the latest research in this
field. The RSS 2017 conference will bring together researchers working on the
latest algorithmic and mathematical foundations of robotics, robotics
applications, and the analysis of robotic systems. The conference will be held
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and will include invited talks as
well as oral and poster presentations of refereed papers. In addition to the
technical aspects of the conference, a series of social events will
provide opportunities for networking and recruiting.
