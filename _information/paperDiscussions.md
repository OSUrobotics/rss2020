<b>The most urgent next step right now is the setup of zoom
meetings for all -- please see below.</b>

### Checking that your session information and zoom meeting is readily setup before July 14

Log into our
[virtual conference site](https://pheedloop.com/rss2020/virtual/) and
search for your session (In the Sessions section, search for your
name/title, or choose filter 'Track Papers'.)

First check the general description and embedded pre-recorded talk. At
the bottom of the description you should also find the full zoom link,
which should be the same send to you by email when we scheduled your
meeting. (You could also retrieve it by logging into zoom.us with the
Email associated to our RSS zoom account.)

Once your session is activated, that same zoom link should also be
behind the embedded zoom window.


### Starting your zoom meeting on July 14/15/16

We recommend that you start your zoom meeting some minutes before the
live paper discussion sessions. And we recommend that -- unlike the
reset of the conference -- you use a desktop client application to
start you zoom session directly using the zoom link, and your zoom
user email. (You can start the session also directly from within
pheedloop, but the desktop client might give more functionality.)

You'll have to start it as host at 15:00 UTC on the day of your
discussion session.



### Zoom Meeting setup

Your live paper discussion sessions on July 14, 15, and 16 will be
held with zoom meetings that are directly accessible from the virtual
conference platform. We have a Business zoom account to serve with all
necessary licenses. However, we need your help to ensure you will have
full control over your meeting, will be able to start it yourself, and
be zoom host.

We offer 3 options to you -- but encourage you very
much to use the first option:

1. Preferred Option 1) We enroll you, as corresponding author, as user
  in our Zoom business account. We then schedule a meeting on your
  behalf, embed it in the virtual conference platform, and you will
  start and host the session at the right time on July 14, 15, or 16
  yourself. This is the easiest option and will ensure you having full
  control (being host) of the zoom meeting.
2. Option 2) You can use your own zoom license, and tell us the meeint
  URL, meeting ID & meeting passwd to embed in the virtual conference
  platform. This option is fine, and you have full control over your
  meeting (being host). But then you need your own license (not a
  time-limited free license) and ensure to setup the meeting.
3. Non-preferred Option 3) We let a student helper own your zoom
  meeting. The student helper starts and hosts the meeting at the
  right time, but then needs to reach out for you to make you host
  (otherwise you will not be able to share the screen). We found this
  to have too many points of failure -- but can work it if necessary.

If you are **corresponding authors**, you should have received an
Email inviting you to our Zoom business account -- assuming that you
follow Option 1. If another author wants to be the lead and host of
your paper discussion session, please let us know by Email!

There is a **caveat** when enrolling as user with our Zoom account:
Your email address might already be associated with another
professional zoom account (e.g., of your university). You cannot use
the same Email address twice to enroll as user to a professional zoom
account. Therefore, in that case, please send us an alternative email
address to make you user of our zoom.

In case you want to **use option 2 or 3 instead**, please contact me
directly until *Wednesday, July 8* with your zoom ID+passwd (or link)
to embed.
