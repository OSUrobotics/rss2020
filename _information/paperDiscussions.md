This page will soon contain more information on the live paper
discussion sessions. The most urtent next step is the setup of zoom
meetings for all:

## Zoom Meeting setup

Your live paper discussion sessions on July 14, 15, and 16 will be
held with zoom meetings that are directly accessible from the virtual
conference platform. We have a Business zoom account to serve with all
necessary licenses. However, we need your help to ensure you will have
full control over your meeting, will be able to start it yourself, and
be zoom host.

We offer 3 options to you -- but encourage you very
much to use the first option:

1. Preferred Option 1) We enroll you, as corresponding author, as user
  in our Zoom business account. We then schedule a meeting on your
  behalf, embed it in the virtual conference platform, and you will
  start and host the session at the right time on July 14, 15, or 16
  yourself. This is the easiest option and will ensure you having full
  control (being host) of the zoom meeting.
2. Option 2) You can use your own zoom license, and tell us the
  meeting ID & passwd (or link) to embed in the virtual conference
  platform. This option is fine, and you have full control over your
  meeting (being host). But this might have the drawback that users
  might have to enter a captcha whenever they want to enter your
  meeting via the platform. And you need your own license (not the
  time-limited free license).
3. Non-preferred Option 3) We let a student helper own your zoom
  meeting. The student helper starts and hosts the meeting at the
  right time, but then needs to reach out for you to make you host
  (otherwise you will not be able to share the screen). We found this
  to have too many points of failure -- but can work it if necessary.

If you are **corresponding authors**, you should have received an
Email inviting you to our Zoom business account -- assuming that you
follow Option 1. If another author wants to be the lead and host of
your paper discussion session, please let us know by Email!

There is a **caveat** when enrolling as user with our Zoom account: Your
email address might already be associated with another professional
zoom account (e.g., of your university). You cannot use the same Email
address twice to enroll as user to a professional zoom
account. Therefore, in that case, please send us an alternative email
address to make you user of our zoom.

In case you want to **use option 2 or 3 instead**, please contact me
directly until *Wednesday, July 8* with your zoom ID+passwd (or link)
to embed.
