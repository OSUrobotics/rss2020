## Paper Format
We only accept submissions in PDF. Submissions may be up to 8 pages in length, including figures but possibly excluding references. Additional pages can be used for references. However, the 9th page, and any subsequent pages, can contain ONLY references. This will be strictly enforced. Submissions can use a font no smaller than 10 point. Submissions violating these guidelines will not be considered. A paper template is available in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/paper-template-latex.tar.gz">Latex</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/paper-template-word.zip">Word</a>. Please read the [detailed instructions]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2016-10-18-paper-format%}).

## Supplementary Material 
Authors may submit supplementary material such as a video or an expanded version of a proof. However, note that reviewers are not required to view this material and include it in their assessment of the paper. Lastly, if authors feel they must link to additional supplementary material, they are cautioned to ensure that their identities are not revealed. Please note that the link to upload supplementary material becomes active only after the paper submission is complete.

## Double Blind Submission
Reviewing for RSS 2017 will be double blind, so authors should not be listed on the title page and reasonable anonymity should be maintained in the paper. Authors are asked to take particular care when referencing their own work - careless use of self citations can easily violate the requirements for double blind reviewing and this will result in papers being rejected. 
Please read the [detailed instructions]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2016-10-18-double-blind%}).

## Multiple Submissions
Submissions that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences are not appropriate for RSS and violate our dual submission policy. Exceptions include technical reports and arXiv.
Please read the [detailed instructions]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2016-10-18-multiple-submissions%}).

## Plagiarism
RSS is utterly intolerant of plagiarism. Submitted papers are expected to contain original work executed by the authors with adequate, proper and scholarly citations to the work of others. It is the job of the authors to clearly identify both their own contribution(s) and also published results / techniques on which they depend or build. RSS reviewers are charged to ensure these standards are met. In cases of alleged plagiarism, the program chair will be guided by Section 8.2.4 Allegations of Misconduct as laid out by the IEEE in this <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/opsmanual.pdf">document</a>.

## Review Process
Please read the [review form]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2016-10-18-review-form%}) to understand our emphasis this year.
Authors, Program Committee members, and Area Chairs will all be anonymous. Each paper will receive 3 reviews. 
This year, we will have no rebuttals nor conditional acceptances.
