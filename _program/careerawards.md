	<b>Biography:</b>
	<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight:normal;">
	Luca Carlone is the Charles Stark Draper Assistant Professor in the
	Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts
	Institute of Technology, and a Principal Investigator in the Laboratory
	for Information & Decision Systems (LIDS). He received his PhD from the
	Polytechnic University of Turin in 2012. He joined LIDS as a
	postdoctoral associate (2015) and later as a Research Scientist (2016),
	after spending two years as a postdoctoral fellow at the Georgia
	Institute of Technology (2013-2015). His research interests include
	nonlinear estimation, numerical and distributed optimization, and
	probabilistic inference, applied to sensing, perception, and
	decision-making in single and multi-robot systems. His work includes
	seminal results on certifiably correct algorithms for localization and
	mapping, as well as approaches for visual-inertial navigation and
	distributed mapping. He is a recipient of the 2017 Transactions on
	Robotics King-Sun Fu Memorial Best Paper Award, the best paper award at
	WAFR’16, the best Student paper award at the 2018 Symposium on VLSI
	Circuits, the best paper award in Robotic Vision at ICRA'20, and he was
	best paper finalist at RSS’15. He is also the recipient of the Google
	Daydream (2019) and the Amazon Research Award (2020), and the MIT
	AeroAstro Vickie Kerrebrock Faculty Award (2020). At MIT, he teaches
	“Robotics: Science and Systems,” the introduction to robotics for MIT
	undergraduates, and he created the graduate-level course “Visual
	Navigation for Autonomous Vehicles”, which covers mathematical
	foundations and fast C++ implementations of spatial perception
	algorithms for drones and autonomous vehicles.

	<b>Biography:</b>
	<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight:normal;">
	Jeannette Bohg is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stanford
	University. She was a group leader at the Autonomous Motion Department
	(AMD) of the MPI for Intelligent Systems until September 2017. Before
	joining AMD in January 2012, Jeannette Bohg was a PhD student at the
	Division of Robotics, Perception and Learning (RPL) at KTH in Stockholm.
	In her thesis, she proposed novel methods towards multi-modal scene
	understanding for robotic grasping. She also studied at Chalmers in
	Gothenburg and at the Technical University in Dresden where she received
	her Master in Art and Technology and her Diploma in Computer Science,
	respectively. Her research focuses on perception and learning for
	autonomous robotic manipulation and grasping. She is specifically
	interesting in developing methods that are goal-directed, real-time and
	multi-modal such that they can provide meaningful feedback for execution
	and learning. Jeannette Bohg has received several awards, most notably
	the 2019 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)
	Best Paper Award, the 2019 IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Early
	Career Award and the 2017 IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)
	Best Paper Award.
