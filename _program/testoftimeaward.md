RSS 2020 introduces the new **RSS Test of Time Award** given to highest
impact papers published at RSS (and potentially journal versions
thereof) from at least ten years ago. Impact may mean that it changed
how we think about problems or about robotic design, that it brought
fully new problems to the attention of the community, or that it
pioneered new approach to robotic design or problem solving.

With this award, RSS generally wants to foster the discussion of the
long term development of our field. The award is an opportunity to
reflect on and discuss the past, which is essential to make progress in
the future. The awardee's keynote is therefore complemented with a
Test of Time Panel session devoted to this important discussion.


It is our great pleasure to announce that this year's Test of Time
Awards goes to the pair of papers:

* **Frank Dellaert**:  [Square  Root  SAM](http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss01/p24.html). Proceedings of Robotics: Science and Systems I, 2005.

* **Frank Dellaert and Michael Kaess**: [Square Root SAM: Simultaneous localization and mapping via square root information smoothing](https://doi.org/10.1177/0278364906072768). International Journal of Robotics Research, 25, 1181-1203, 2006.

*for pioneering an information smoothing approach to the SLAM problem via square root factorization, its interpretation as a graphical model, and the widely-used GTSAM free software repository.*


### Award Keynote

Please joint the awardee's keynote on July 14, 10:00 PT:

<b>Title: *Factor Graphs: Exploiting Structure in Robotics*</b>

**Abstract:** Many estimation, planning and optimal control problems in
robotics have an optimization problem at their core. In most of these
optimization problems, the objective function is composed of many
different factors or terms that are local in nature, i.e., they only
depend on a small subset of the variables. A particularly insightful
way of modeling this locality structure is using the concept of factor
graphs, a bipartite graphical model in which factors represent
functions on subsets of variables. Factor graphs can represent a wide
variety of problems across robotics, expose opportunities to improve
computational performance, and are beneficial in designing and
thinking about how to model a problem, even aside from performance
considerations. We discuss each of these three aspects in detail, and
review a number of state of the art robotics applications in which
factor graphs have been used with great success.

	<b>Biography:</b>
	<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight:normal;">

Frank Dellaert is a Professor in the School of Interactive Computing
at the Georgia Institute of Technology and a Research Scientist at
Google AI. While on leave from Georgia Tech in 2016-2018, he served as
Technical Project Lead at Facebook's Building 8 hardware
division. Before that he was also Chief Scientist at Skydio, a startup
founded by MIT grads to create intuitive interfaces for micro-aerial
vehicles. His research is in the overlap between robotics and computer
vision, and he is particularly interested in graphical model
techniques to solve large-scale problems in mapping, 3D
reconstruction, and increasingly model-predictive control. The GTSAM
toolbox embodies many of the ideas his research group has worked on in
the past few years and is available at https://gtsam.org.

	<b>Biography:</b>
	<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight:normal;">

Michael Kaess is an Associate Research Professor in the Robotics
Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Prior to joining CMU,
he was a Research Scientist and a Postdoctoral Associate in the
Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He received the Ph.D. and
M.S. degrees in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of
Technology. He was one of the two runner-ups for the 2012 Volz
dissertation award for the best U.S. Ph.D. thesis in robotics and
automation, and also received four runner-up best paper awards at ICRA
and IROS. He serves as Associate Editor for the IEEE Robotics and
Automation Letters and has previously served as Associate Editor for
the IEEE Transactions on Robotics. His research focuses on
probabilistic methods for robot perception, in particular efficient
algorithms for navigation, mapping and localization. He is the main
author of the incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM/iSAM2)
algorithms.
