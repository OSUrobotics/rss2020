Winners are selected from a group of finalists by an awards committee. 
Here is a list of past [finalists and winners](http://www.roboticsfoundation.org/index.php/awards).


### Best Paper Award
This award is given the the best paper of the conference. 

### Best Student Paper Award

### Best Systems Paper Award in Memory of [Seth Teller](http://people.csail.mit.edu/teller/)

This award is given to outstanding systems papers presented at the RSS conference. The awards committee determines each year if a paper of sufficient quality is among the accepted papers and may decide not to give the award. In years when no award is given, the list of finalists will not be disclosed. This award was given for the first time in 2015 ([more information](http://www.roboticsfoundation.org/index.php/awards?id=15)).

### Outstanding Reviewer Acknowledgement

Reviewers are the life blood of a conference. Although not an award, this acknowledgement provides an opportunity to 
highlight and thank our most outstanding reviewers nominated by the Area Chairs.
