### Abstract
<html><p style="color:gray; font-size: 120%; text-align: justified;">
We propose NH-TTC, a general method for fast, anticipatory collision avoidance for autonomous robots with arbitrary equations of motions. Our approach exploits implicit differentiation and subgradient descent to locally  optimize  the  non-convex and non-smooth cost  functions  that  arise  from  planning  over  the anticipated  future positions of nearby obstacles. The result is a flexible framework capable of supporting high-quality, collision-free navigation with a wide variety of robot motion models in various challenging scenarios. We show results for different navigating tasks, with various numbers of agents (with and without reciprocity), on both physical differential drive robots, and simulated robots with different motion models and kinematic and dynamic constraints, including acceleration-controlled agents, differential-drive agents, and smooth car-like agents. The resulting paths are high quality and collision-free, while needing only a few milliseconds of computation as part of an integrated sense-plan-act navigation loop.
