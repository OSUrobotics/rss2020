Simulators are a powerful tool for reasoning about a robot&#8217;s interactions with its environment. However, when simulations diverge from reality, that reasoning becomes less useful. In this paper, we evaluate closing the loop between simulation and reality by using observations of real liquids to correct errors when tracking the liquid&#8217;s state in a simulator. Our results show that closed-loop simulation is an effective way to prevent large divergence between the simulated and real liquid states, and additionally that this method can enable reasoning about liquids that would otherwise be infeasible.
