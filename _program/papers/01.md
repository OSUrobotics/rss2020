Based on the convex force-motion polynomial model for quasi-static sliding, we derive the kinematic contact model to determine the contact modes and instantaneous object motion on a supporting surface given a position controlled manipulator. The inherently stochastic object-to-surface friction distribution is modelled by sampling physically consistent parameters from appropriate distributions, with only one parameter to control the amount of noise.  Thanks to the high fidelity and smoothness of convex polynomial models, the mechanics of patch contact is captured while being computationally efficient without mode selection at support points. The motion equations for both single and multiple frictional contacts are given. Simulation based on the model is validated with robotic pushing and grasping experiments.
